This backup script, at the moment, only backs up to Rackspace Cloud.

To use this script, you must also have downloaded and installed the Cloudfiles API hooks for Rackspace.  These can be found at:

https://github.com/rackspace/python-cloudfiles/tree

Be sure to edit the first 40 lines to your preference.  These will eventually be pulled out to a seperate config file, which will also allow the use of different backup destinations.
